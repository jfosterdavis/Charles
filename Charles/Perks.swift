    //Roberte can unlock almost every perk, except for the highest level perks, of those s/he imitates.  This makes Roberte very handy.
    //John is the only one who can unlock Emeritus. He can also unlock highest level of insight. This makes John possibly the only one who can allow player to win the game.
    //Laura and John only can unlock Synesthesia
    //Charles and Fred are same price and level, need both (unless Roberte) to unlock all Stacks perks
    //Stanly and Jr. are required to get most out of Insight (unless Roberte)
    //Matthew and Charles are only that can get In the Ballpark
    //
    //Synesthesia designed to be low cost and last long enough to not annoy the user.  This is really for users that hate the annoying voices!  Higher levels give much longer duration.
    //Insight allows player to see the stickView which shows colors in a physical form.  Colorblind users may like this.  Designed to be not to expensive and easy to obtain. higher levels get up to 1 week
    //Study increases XP gained from each successful match.  Expensive and slow to obtain.  They stack additively, so a user that has all unlocked could get +6 (=7) xp each time they succeed.  Highest level very expensive and hard to obtain.  Highest level only unlockable at high character level because it requires John
    //Stacks gives multiplicative bonuses to score, which stack. Player could get up to 12X score each time.  Short duration.  Lowe levels easy to obtain, higher levels not as easy.
    //Closeenough reduces the precision requirements to progress in a level.  Higher levels require so much precision they will be near impossible without this perk.  lower levels easy to obtain and have a mild duration.  Higher levels very expensive and short duration.
